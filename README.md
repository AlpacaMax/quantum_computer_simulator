# Quantum Computer Simulator(python)

This script is a simple simulation of quantum computer implemented with python3.

## Usage
The simulator requires `numpy`. In the terminal type:
```
pip3 install numpy
```

The simulator is currently very basic and crude and I will keep optimizing the code(probably).
